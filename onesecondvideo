One Second Video

Contact:onesecond@gmail.com

'Every Second' are inspired by TED's Speech 'Pack Every Second in a Pocket'. 
In order to realize the speaker's idea, this application was born. 
The application is not for commercial use and all functions are free.

What should we pay attention to?
1. Please allow Every Second access to camera and microphone rights. 
   Rejecting one of them will result in video recording failure. 
   Please modify it in System Settings-Privacy. 
2. If you want to delete this application, 
   please go to the Diary to save the video to the local area before deleting the operation, 
   in order to avoid the loss of video data.

How to export videos? How to share videos?
1. Please allow Every Second access to photos, 
   click on wonderful stories in Diary, 
   click the Save button and wait for the rendering to be completed before exporting to local photos.
2. Users who need to share videos, please save the videos locally first, 
   and then upload them to other video sharing applications for sharing.

Where are the videos saved every day?
Video taken every day will be stored in the memory of the mobile phone. 
Please rest assured that the space occupied by the video taken every day in your pocket is very small. 
You can also periodically clear the cache in the settings.

I forgot to take it one day. Can I make it up?
1. Do not support re-shooting for the time being, 
   remember to keep records every day in the future.
2. You can re-shoot on the same day, 
   and save directly after shooting can cover the footage taken before that day.

Why can only shoot a short video a day?
Of course, you can also change the recording time in Other, 
every day is very precious, hope that a short pocket can trigger your memories of the whole day,
and slowly integrate the time into one minute, one hour ...
